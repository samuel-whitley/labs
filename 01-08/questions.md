In this assignment, we'll implement a version of tic-tac-toe that we can play from the command line.
You should push what you have by Monday at 8am.
**Incomplete work that is on time and later refined is preferred to late work that is complete and bug-free.**

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you shouldâ€¦

* Understand IO and be able to interact with users
* Know how to use data structures to model state
* Think about how to structure logic and break things into functions in longer programs

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you be able to effectively use

* `def` to define functions and express functionality
* `gets` and `puts` to handle IO
* control flow via `if` / `else`
* looping constructs like `while` or `until`
*

## Details

### Deliverables

* A script `tic-tac-toe.rb`

### Requirements

* Running `ruby tic-tac-toe.rb` should play a game of tic-tac-toe in the terminal.

## Easy Mode

The script should play a game of tic-tac-toe to completion and print the game's outcome. Each turn, the script displays the current board and prompts the user for a move.
It may either have two human players or a human player and a computer player that chooses a move randomly.

## Normal Mode

The script should fulfill the *Easy Mode* requirements and support both a human **and** computer second player.

## Nightmare Mode

Add better AI (hardcoding "if the board is this, play this" is tractable, but there are other approaches, depending on how nightmarish you want to go).

## Notes

This project is deliberately non-proscriptive. Start. Write some code. Don't worry too much about getting it perfect. Make some mistakes. We'll revisit this shortly.
In this assignment, we'll implement a version of tic-tac-toe that we can play from the command line.
